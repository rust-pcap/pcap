# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Updated `windows-sys` from `0.36.1` to `0.59.0`.
  Users of `Capture::get_event()` on Windows platforms should note that
  `HANDLE` is a `isize` in `0.36`, but has been made a pointer in `0.59`,
  causing types containing it to no longer be autotraited with `Send`.

### Added

- Added `packet_header_size()` for applications that need to know the size of internal type
  `pcap_pkthdr` (for instance to calculate exact send queue sizes).

## [2.2.0] - 2024-09-01

### Added

- Added an implementation of `AsFd` on `Capture<Active>` on non-Windows.

## [2.1.0] - 2024-08-27

### Added

- Add `want_pktap` on `Capture<Inactive>` for Mac OS.

## [2.0.0] - 2024-04-21

### Changed

- Rust Edition is now `2021`.
- MSRV is now `1.63.0`.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-03-15

### Added

- Binding for `pcap_loop` added. It can be accessed via the `for_each` call on Activated captures.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-19

### Added

- `capture-stream` support added for Windows.

## [1.1.0] - 2023-05-12

### Added

- `lending-iter` UNSTABLE feature that introduces lending iterator using GATs.

### Changed

- Examples in the docs have been fixed.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-11-19

### Changed

- Public API declared stable.

## [0.11.0] - 2022-10-01

### Added

- `SendQueue::queue_sg()` can add scattered packets, as a slice of
  `std::io::IoSlice`s, to `SendQueue`s.

### Changed

- Rename `sendqueue::Sync` to `sendqueue::SendSync` to avoid collision with
  `Sync` in std's prelude.
- Build script will fall back to `pkg-config` if available and `LIBPCAP_LIBDIR`
  hasn't been explicitly set.

## [0.10.1] - 2022-08-17

### Changed

- MSRV is now `1.46.0`.

## [0.10.0] - 2022-08-16

### Added

- [doc](https://docs.rs/pcap/latest/pcap/) will now include all features.
- Support for sendqueues on Windows.
- `PacketStream::capture_mut` to still be able to inject packets when using `PacketStream`.
- `Capture::iter()` that return an iterator that use a codec like `Capture::stream()`.
- `Packet<Dead>::dead_with_precision` to enable creating a pcap with nanosecond precision.
- `flags` field to `Device`.

### Removed

- `BpfProgram` no longer have `Clone` implementation see [#261](https://github.com/rust-pcap/pcap/issues/261)

### Changed

- MSRV is now `1.41.0`.
- `PacketStream` has been moved from mod `stream` to the `root` of the crate.
- `PacketCodec` has been moved from mod `stream` to the `root` of the crate.
- `PacketCodec::decode()` no longer returns a `Result`.
- `PacketCodec::Type` has been renamed to `PacketCodec::Item`.
- `Device::lookup` now returns `Result<Option<Device>, Error>` rather than `Result<Device, Error>`. `Ok(None)` means that the lookup succeeded, but no suitable devices were available. This is consistent with libpcap.
- `Capture` and `Savefile` no longer implement the `Sync` trait. The underlying `libpcap` library does not promise thread-safe access for the same capture object from multiple threads.
- Switched from `winapi` to `windows-sys` for Windows builds. `windows-sys` requires rustc 1.46.0.
- `Capture::next` have been rename `next_packet` to avoid any confusion with `Iterator::next`.

### Removed

- mod `stream` is no longer public.
- `docs-rs` feature.
- `full` feature.
- `stream::SelectableFd` and `stream::PacketStream::new` as they were only meant to be used internally.

## [0.9.2] - 2022-04-15

### Changed

- `capture-stream` requires rustc version 1.49.0 due to dependency on `tokio`.

## [0.9.1] - 2021-11-07

### Added

- Support for device addresses.

## [0.9.0] - 2021-09-05

### Added

- `savefile.flush` support.

### Changed

- Updated dependency `tokio` from version 0.2 to 1.0.
- `capture-stream` requires rustc version 1.45.0 due to dependency on `tokio`.

## [0.8.1] - 2020-12-30

### Changed

- Fix docs.rs build.

## [0.8.0] - 2020-12-30

### Added

- `Derive(Clone)` to `Device` struct (#100).
- Build-time `libpcap` version detection.
- Support for immediate mode.
- Const value for Linktype (#145).
- Support for BPF compile.

### Changed

- Opt into Rust 2018.
- Now minimum supported rustc version is 1.40.0.
- Updated dependency from deprecated `tokio-core` to `tokio` 0.2.
- Updated dependency `futures` from version 0.1 to 0.3.
- Feature `tokio` renamed to `capture-stream` because Cargo does not allow features and dependencies to have the same name.
- `PCAP_LIBDIR` renamed to `LIBPCAP_LIBDIR` to distinguish the `pcap` crate from the `libpcap` library.
- All methods that construct objects out of a `RawFd` are now unsafe.
- All methods that take a raw pointer are now unsafe. Some of these functions
  were renamed from `new` to `from_handle` to underline this.

### Removed

- Feature flags `pcap-savefile-append`, `pcap-fopen-offline-precision` (replaced by build-time `libpcap` version detection).

## [0.7.0] - 2017-08-04
